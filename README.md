# Master thesis
## Balder G. Klanderud
This repository contains the code developed in the writing of this thesis. 
The code consists of some python files that creates and analyzes machine learning models,
and embedded firmware that contains some of the machine learning models developed.

To use the python code in this repository, a Python 3 interpreter, with all the libraries used are required.
The embedded code is initially generated using the STM32CubeMX tool, with the X-Cube-AI add-on.

The embedded code is compiled using the CMake file, and the arm-none-eabi-gcc-9.2.1 compiler.
